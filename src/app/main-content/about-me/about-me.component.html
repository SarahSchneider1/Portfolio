                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I am a German-speaking frontend developer from near Kempten in the Allg√§u. Motivated by the limitless possibilities in IT, I develop intuitive websites and applications. </p>

                <p>My focus is on developing user-friendly websites and applications that are not only technically impressive, but also aesthetically pleasing. I see challenges as an opportunity to deepen my knowledge and find new solutions.</p>

                <p>For me, programming is like hiking in the mountains: a clear goal in sight, the path sometimes rocky, but the view from the summit - the finished result - is priceless. Every challenge is a rock that I overcome, and it is precisely this creative process that motivates me again and again.</p>
